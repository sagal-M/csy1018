     <h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>This report is about my experiences this module with learning the basics of web development, coding, design and debugging process.
     Overall I have enjoyed developing a knowledge and better understanding in each of the different areas within web development. 
     As a beginner, learning even the basics of code was very challenging, because I have not done much before. 
     Through research and troubleshooting, I slowly grew to understand them, but I know there is still much more that I could learn. </p>
<p>By using a logical and step-by-step approach, I have been surprised at what I have been able to produce with my Portfolio site. </p>

<h1>Week one and two</h1>
<p>Firstly, I started with learning the basic of using html and understanding that every web page uses HTML. The code editor that I used for html was Visual studio code which I was able to get the hand of quite easily. 
    Next I then moved onto learning css and about how html and css both link. 
     After attempting the tasks for both html and css I was able to see exactly what they both do, with only using html I realised that the browser make assumptions about how the site should look however once you add a css file you can override this behaviour and describe how these elements should look,
      this was very helpful to know when making my site. </p>

<h1> Week three and four</h1>     
<p>After fully understanding the purpose of both html and css, 
    I then moved onto learning how to make web pages responsive which is very useful as I want to be able to make my site mobile friendly, 
    when making a web page responsive I was able to learn some tips on how to make the web page fit on  mobile phone screen, for example, 
    I now know how to create a hamburger icon so that everything on the page is not squished together.
     I also attempted some activities on creating animations with transitions and different hover effects. </p>

<h1>Week five</h1>
<p>Once I had received the brief for creating my portfolio site I was able to begin the process of creating all the different pages for my site. 
I started with creating a folder which will have all of the files that will be needed for my portfolio site , 
I then started to created the home page for the site which will be the first page that people see when they enter my site, 
I had to carefuly think about the layout and the colours, I decided to use pink as my main themed colour for my site this is because it is a portfolio about myself and my work and pink if one of my favourite colours, 
i first chose a very bright pink however once I saw how it looked I decided to go for a more subtle pink as it was very distracting,
 one problem that I had with my first page was that the changes I was making on my css file was not reflecting on my home page however I then realised that this was because I did not link the css file to the html file. 
  Before moving on to a different page I had to create a navigation bar at the top of the page so that it can be easy to move from page to page this is going to be on each page I created. 
  I decided to make the navigation bar light blue because it goes well with pink also the font that was I used was very basic and not too small or big so that it is easy to use.</p>

<p>Once the navigation bar was created I was then able to create each of the other four pages and easily copy and paste the navigation bar code onto each page 
only changing the link which as very time effective as I didnâ€™t have to re write each time. </p>
<p>The next page that I created was my portfolio page, this page now only contains place holder images   that will eventually be replaced with my work throughout the years.
     For this page I used columns so that I can demonstrate my skills also as it looks better once the columns were added. 
     One problem that I faced was that I did not know that you had to have separate css files for each page this is because 
     if you want the design and layout of the pages to be slightly different each html file will needs it own stylesheet.
      The next page was a contact me page, for this page I used a form where the users will have to input their details
       and also information on where to fine me. For the third page it was a blog page this page was very similar to the portfolios page 
       as I decided to use columns again, one thing I noticed while creating my portfolio site was that each time I completed a page the next page would be easier to complete because I was getting more and more used to it.<P>

       </P> 

<p>       After completing every page for the portfolio site, I went through each one to make sure everything was in its proper location and that nothing needed to be changed in terms of appearance. After that was done,
     I used an html validator and a css validator to check my code for problems and to assist me identify where each one was. </p>
